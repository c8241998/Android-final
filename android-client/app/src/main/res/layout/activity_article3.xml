Today, with the upgrade of Kuala Lung to an international port and the completion of infrastructure renovation such as roads, this ancient Sino-Nepalese trade road is revitalized and renewed.
    In recent years, with the gradual completion and improvement of key transportation projects such as Lalin Highway, Zegong Highway and La-Japan Railway, Tibet's three-dimensional transportation network will take on a new look.
    According to the data of the Transport Department of Tibet Autonomous Region, the transportation industry in Tibet has developed rapidly in the past five years, adding 24,000 kilometers of highway mileage. By the end of 2017, the total mileage of highway in Tibet has reached 89,000 kilometers. In the next three years, Tibet will further implement the project of rural highway accessibility, striving to achieve all villages and towns, constructed villages and roads by the end of the 13th Five-Year Plan, and all natural villages will have access to highways. At present, the rural highway in Tibet is more than 60,000 kilometers long, and the whole area is connected to oil routes except Motuo County."
