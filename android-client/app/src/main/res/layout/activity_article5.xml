                android:text="    Volcanic eruption is a natural phenomenon. The reason is that the molten material in the earth is ejected under pressure. There are active volcanoes, extinct volcanoes and dormant volcanoes. The only way to control volcanic activity is to prevent it in advance.
    The temperature and density of the earth's interior are not uniform, and mantle convection or plume are formed in the interior of the mantle. When high-temperature materials rise to the shallow part of the earth, partial melting occurs due to reduced pressure. Under the action of external forces, these molten materials converge and form magma sacs in the shallow part of the earth. When the pressure of magma sac is greater than that of stratum, magma will break through the crust along faults or weak places, resulting in volcanic eruption.
    Another cause of volcanoes is plate interaction, such as in subduction or collision zones of plates. Local high temperatures are formed due to friction. Dehydration of some water-bearing minerals also reduces the melting point of rocks. At this time, magma sacs are formed, which can trigger volcanic activity."
